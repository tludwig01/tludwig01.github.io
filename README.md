Hi everyone!

This is a fairly straightforward game of trivia. You get to cycle through questions that I've come up with regarding some of my favorite worlds. In round one, you'll be venturing through Middle Earth, round 2 will wander the halls of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and round 3 through Westeros and beyond!

Created almost solely from Javascript and jQuery, it was my goal to make the display screen as clean as possible, depicting one single question at a time, along with the answer selections and each player's score. 

How it works:

1) This is a player versus player game. 
2) Each round has 10 questions (30 total). 
3) Players ALTERNATE answering each question until the round is over. Score is kept on a running basis. For each correct answer, 1 point is added, for each incorrect answer, nothing is added but shame, and the game continues. console.log(" *rings bell* Shame! *rings bell* ");
4) At the end of the third round, the final scores are tallied and the victor is declared. You can tie, too! If you've made it 30 questions and both players have the same score, you both know what's up and who am I to take that away from one of you. Good stuff. 

Simple? Yes. Pretty? Hardly. Mine? YUP!
